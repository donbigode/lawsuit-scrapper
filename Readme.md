This project is designed to scrape data from the TJSP website, based on a list of lawsuits provided in a CSV file. The results are then saved to an Excel file.

Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed. This project was developed using Python 3.11, but it should be compatible with Python 3.x versions.

The following Python packages are required:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML and extracting data.
openpyxl: To read from and write to Excel files.
Install all requirements by running:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place your input CSV file named gfsa_processos.csv in the same directory as the script.
Run the script:
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
After execution, you'll find an Excel file named processos_results.xlsx in the same directory, containing the scraped data.
Notes
Always ensure you have the right to scrape a website. Respect robots.txt and terms of service of the website.
Adjust the max_workers parameter in the script if needed to avoid making too many simultaneous requests.
The script uses relative paths, so the input and output files will always be in the same directory as the script.
